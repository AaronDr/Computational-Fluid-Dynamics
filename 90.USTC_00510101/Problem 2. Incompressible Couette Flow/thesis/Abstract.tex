Incompressible Couette flow represents an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, which is perhaps the simplest of all viscous flow.
This report deals with an implicit finite-difference solution to the parabolic partial difference governing equations, both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are discussed. 
To solve the system of linear equations, specifically, in tridiagonal form, Thomas Algorithm is employed.
