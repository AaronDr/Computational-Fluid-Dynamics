This report deals with the quasi-one-dimensional flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle. First, consider the subsonic-supersonic isentropic nozzle flow, the governing equation is of non-conservation form. Next, apply the conservation form of governing equation to the same problem. Finally, study a case of shock capturing with the addition of artificial viscosity. We get numerical solutions by employing MacCormack Scheme.
